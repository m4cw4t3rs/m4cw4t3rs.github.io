		<p>mac waters (they/he) (b. 2000) is a NYC-based musician—composer, performer, improviser, producer, listener—who performs in a variety of interdisciplinary contexts. their artistic practice defies binaries and categorization—they do not believe in genre and see no use for it. the core of their current work explores the anxiety of a digital generation coming-of-age, the theater of everyday life, humor & spontaneity, performance practice itself, and transhistorical narrative. waters has worked in a variety of mediums, some of which include composing chamber music for contemporary ensembles such as Ars Futura (Cleveland), Fonema Consort (Chicago), Wet Ink (NYC), and Mivos Quartet (NYC), composing electroacoustic music for film and dance, performing as a vocalist and violist in various interdisciplinary and multimedia performances, and electronically producing remixes as well as original music. waters is currently a third-year undergraduate student at Columbia University where they are pursuing a degree in music composition with a special concentration in medieval and renaissance Studies, studying composition intensely with Georg Haas, Zosha diCastri, Eric Wubbels, and Keith Fitch. Waters is also the current program director for <a href="https://www.cc-seas.columbia.edu/wkcr/">WKCR-FM NY 89.9</a>, where they oversee 24/7 radio programming of underrepresented/underplayed music and deejay for the Classical and New Music departments. they also serve on the executive board for Columbia New Music, an organization of undergraduates that organizes student-led events to foster an inclusive community of new music for Columbia students. other interests include run-on sentences, troubadour song, Kathy Acker, TikTok (as cultural phenomenon, historical database, timewaster), collage, citationality, Clue (1985), and Mario Kart. </p>
